# Set Theory

## Disclaimer

This artical is meant for math lovers, not for beginners.

## What is set?

It is a math model to represent a collection of things with some common properties.

## All about logical relationship

In languages, there is called logical hierarchy to make connections of words and objects. Set is that model in math.
As we all know, eventually programming is about data, but data that are processed, i.e. with meanings through logical relation.
When we are talking about big O, big ![theta](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Theta), big ![omega](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Omega&space;), we are talking about sets and its membership.
